Proteogenomics is a field of biological research that utilizes a combination of proteomics, genomics, and transcriptomics to aid in the discovery and identification/quantification of peptides and proteins. Proteogenomics is used to identify new peptides by comparing MS/MS spectra against a protein database that has been derived from genomic and transcriptomics information.

In this approach, customized protein sequence databases generated using genomic and transcriptomic information are used to help identify novel peptides (not present in reference protein sequence databases) from mass spectrometry–based proteomic data; in turn, the proteomic data can be used to provide protein-level evidence of gene expression and to help refine gene models.

Proteogenomics can be also seen as the way to present proteomics evidences in to genomics context.
